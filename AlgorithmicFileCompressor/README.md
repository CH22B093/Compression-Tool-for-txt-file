# Algorithmic File Compressor

This project is a C++ implementation of an Algorithmic File Compressor using various data structures and compression algorithms.

## Features

- Developed efficient C++ text compression algorithm using Heaps, Binary Trees, HashMap, Priority Queue etc. data structures, with Huffman coding and achieved overall 20%-90% of compression.
- Implemented seamless decoding techniques for the retrieval of original text file, ensuring data integrity. This was achieved by optimized space utilization by using fewer bits for frequent characters.
